- `header`: a unique identifier for each peptide sequence consisting of its `protein_id` / `mat_pept_id` / `reg_id` and the virus's unique Sort number separated by an underscore ('_'), e.g. `AAAAAA.1_1`
- `translation`: the amino acid sequence for this peptide
- `gene`, `product`, `note`: annotation relating to what this peptide is derived from NCBI
- `protein_id`: the protein NCBI identifier, including its version (separated by '.'), e.g. `AAAAAA.1`
- `mat_pept_id`: this is the protein NCBI ID of the entry that this mature peptide was derived from followed by a '.' and a number unique to this mature peptide in the protein entry, e.g. `AAAAAA.1.1`
- `reg_id`: this is the protein NCBI ID of the entry that this region was derived from followed by a '.1.' and a number unique to this region in the protein entry, e.g. `AAAAAA.1.1.1`
- `uniq_id`: the `protein_id` / `mat_pept_id` / `reg_id` depending on what peptide category the entry falls under
- `pept_cat`: the peptide category, i.e. protein, mature peptide, or region
- `nt_acc`: the nucleotide (genome or segment) NCBI ID that the peptide was derived from (including its version), e.g. `AAAAAA.1`
- `acc`: the nucleotide (genome or segment) NCBI ID that the peptide was derived from (without its version), e.g. `AAAAAA`
- `protlen`: the protein length
- `seg`: the segment annotation if the protein was derived from a segmented virus
- `Sort`: the ICTV metadata unique number for each virus entry
- `host`: the host annotation if that was available in the NCBI genome entry
- `coordinates`: the coordinates NCBI annotation mapping to the: i) genome/segment if the entry is a protein, ii) protein if the entry is a mature peptide or region
- all other columns are derived from the [ICTV virus metadata resource](msl38v2/VMR_MSL38_v2.xlsx) and should be self-explanatory
