# Viro3D: a comprehensive database of virus protein structure predictions

Data and code associated with structural analysis described in "Viro3D: a comprehensive database of virus protein structure predictions" by Ulad Litvin, Spyros Lytras, Alexander Jack, David L Robertson, Joseph Hughes, and Joe Grove.

Best protein structure predictions produced in this study are available at https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/. The rest of the data including all ColabFold and ESMFold models, associated MSA, pLDDT, pTM, PAE data and Viro3D Foldseek database with structural cluster and network metadata are available on Zenodo (Part 1: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15622906 and Part 2: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15745595).
